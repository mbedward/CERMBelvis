# cermbELVIS

An R package with functions to query the data directory of the ELVIS archive of LiDAR point cloud 
data maintained by Geoscience Australia (https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/). Written for use by the
Centre for Environmental Risk Management of Bushfires, University of Wollongong.

Presently, the functions in the package are just a quick hack to make it easier to query the
available LiDAR data sets for specified areas.
